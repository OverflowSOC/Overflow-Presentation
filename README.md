### Cyber Defense / SOC Analyst  

After a successful 10+ year career in luxury retail management, where I developed strong skills in customer relationship, process optimization, risk management, and team leadership. I made a deliberate transition into cybersecurity. Over the past two years, I have immersed myself in cyber defense fundamentals through hands-on labs, continuous training, and certifications including CompTIA Security+ and the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

Today, I am excited to bring this analytical mindset, discipline, and customer-focused approach to my new role as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst, where I am committed to growing, contributing, and strengthening my organization’s security posture.
