###  Cyber Defense / SOC Analyst

After a successful 10+ years career in luxury retail management, where i honed skills in process optimization, risk management, but also leading and mentoring teams. I have made a deliberate pivot into cybersecurity. Driven by passion for technology and the need for a new challenge, i have spent the last year immersing myself in cyberdefense principles, completing hands-on labsn and earning my CompTIA Security+ certification. My goal is to apply my analytical mindset and dedication to a Tier 1 SOC Analyst Role.

## Featured Projects
This is the most important section. Each project needs its own repository with a detailed write-up. Think of it as a case study.

### 1. <a href="https://github.com/OverflowSOC/Detection-Lab/tree/main"> Active Directory Home Lab & Threat Detection 
In this project, I built a small enterprise environment to simulate real-world attack techniques and practice my detection and analysis skills using a SIEM.

* **Repository Link:** [**View Project Details Here**](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)
* **Description:** Deployed a fully functional Active Directory environment with multiple Windows clients and a server. I used this lab to simulate common attacks like Pass-the-Hash and Kerberoasting, forwarded logs to a SIEM, and wrote detection rules to catch the malicious activity.
* **Technologies Used:**

### 2. SOC Automation & Incident Response Workflow
This project focuses on automating the initial stages of an incident response workflow, from alert ingestion to case creation and observable enrichment.

* **Repository Link:** [**View Project Details Here**](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)
* **Description:** I configured a workflow to parse phishing email alerts, automatically create a case in TheHive, and enrich observables (IPs, domains, file hashes) using Shuffle SOAR and integrated threat intelligence APIs.
* **Technologies Used:**
